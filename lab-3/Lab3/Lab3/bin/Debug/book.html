A public place.</p><blockquote> Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.</blockquote><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>I strike quickly, being moved.</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou</p><p>art moved, thou runn’st away.</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>A dog of that house shall move me to stand.</p><p>I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to</p><p>the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and</p><p>thrust his maids to the wall.</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the</p><p>men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>The heads of the maids?</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense</p><h2>thou wilt.</h2><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>They must take it in sense that feel it.</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a</p><p>pretty piece of flesh.</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.</p><p>Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.</p><blockquote> Enter Abram and Balthasar.</blockquote><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>How? Turn thy back and run?</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><h2>Fear me not.</h2><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>No, marry; I fear thee!</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to</p><p>them if they bear it.</p><h2>ABRAM.</h2><p>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>I do bite my thumb, sir.</p><h2>ABRAM.</h2><p>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>Is the law of our side if I say ay?</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><h2>No.</h2><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.</p><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>Do you quarrel, sir?</p><h2>ABRAM.</h2><p>Quarrel, sir? No, sir.</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.</p><h2>ABRAM.</h2><h2>No better.</h2><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><h2>Well, sir.</h2><h2> Enter Benvolio.</h2><h2>GREGORY.</h2><p>Say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.</p><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><h2>Yes, better, sir.</h2><h2>ABRAM.</h2><h2>You lie.</h2><h2>SAMPSON.</h2><p>Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.</p><h2> [_They fight._]</h2><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>Part, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.</p><blockquote> [_Beats down their swords._]</blockquote><h2> Enter Tybalt.</h2><h2>TYBALT.</h2><p>What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?</p><p>Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>I do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,</p><p>Or manage it to part these men with me.</p><h2>TYBALT.</h2><p>What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word</p><p>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:</p><p>Have at thee, coward.</p><h2> [_They fight._]</h2><blockquote> Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.</blockquote><h2>FIRST CITIZEN.</h2><p>Clubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!</p><p>Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!</p><blockquote> Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.</blockquote><h2>CAPULET.</h2><p>What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!</p><h2>LADY CAPULET.</h2><p>A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?</p><h2>CAPULET.</h2><p>My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,</p><p>And flourishes his blade in spite of me.</p><blockquote> Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.</blockquote><h2>MONTAGUE.</h2><p>Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.</p><h2>LADY MONTAGUE.</h2><p>Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.</p><blockquote> Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.</blockquote><h2>PRINCE.</h2><p>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</p><p>Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—</p><p>Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,</p><p>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</p><p>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</p><p>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</p><p>Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground</p><p>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</p><p>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</p><p>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</p><p>Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,</p><p>And made Verona’s ancient citizens</p><p>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,</p><p>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</p><p>Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.</p><p>If ever you disturb our streets again,</p><p>Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</p><p>For this time all the rest depart away:</p><p>You, Capulet, shall go along with me,</p><p>And Montague, come you this afternoon,</p><p>To know our farther pleasure in this case,</p><p>To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.</p><p>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</p><blockquote> [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,</blockquote><blockquote> Citizens and Servants._]</blockquote><h2>MONTAGUE.</h2><p>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?</p><p>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>Here were the servants of your adversary</p><p>And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.</p><p>I drew to part them, in the instant came</p><p>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,</p><p>Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,</p><p>He swung about his head, and cut the winds,</p><p>Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.</p><p>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows</p><p>Came more and more, and fought on part and part,</p><p>Till the Prince came, who parted either part.</p><h2>LADY MONTAGUE.</h2><p>O where is Romeo, saw you him today?</p><p>Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun</p><p>Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,</p><p>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,</p><p>Where underneath the grove of sycamore</p><p>That westward rooteth from this city side,</p><p>So early walking did I see your son.</p><p>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,</p><p>And stole into the covert of the wood.</p><p>I, measuring his affections by my own,</p><p>Which then most sought where most might not be found,</p><p>Being one too many by my weary self,</p><p>Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,</p><p>And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.</p><h2>MONTAGUE.</h2><p>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</p><p>With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,</p><p>Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;</p><p>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</p><p>Should in the farthest east begin to draw</p><p>The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,</p><p>Away from light steals home my heavy son,</p><p>And private in his chamber pens himself,</p><p>Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out</p><p>And makes himself an artificial night.</p><p>Black and portentous must this humour prove,</p><p>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</p><h2>MONTAGUE.</h2><p>I neither know it nor can learn of him.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>Have you importun’d him by any means?</p><h2>MONTAGUE.</h2><p>Both by myself and many other friends;</p><p>But he, his own affections’ counsellor,</p><p>Is to himself—I will not say how true—</p><p>But to himself so secret and so close,</p><p>So far from sounding and discovery,</p><p>As is the bud bit with an envious worm</p><p>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</p><p>Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</p><p>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,</p><p>We would as willingly give cure as know.</p><h2> Enter Romeo.</h2><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>See, where he comes. So please you step aside;</p><p>I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.</p><h2>MONTAGUE.</h2><p>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay</p><p>To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,</p><blockquote> [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]</blockquote><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>Good morrow, cousin.</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>Is the day so young?</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>But new struck nine.</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>Ay me, sad hours seem long.</p><p>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>Not having that which, having, makes them short.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><h2>In love?</h2><h2>ROMEO.</h2><h2>Out.</h2><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><h2>Of love?</h2><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>Out of her favour where I am in love.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>Alas that love so gentle in his view,</p><p>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,</p><p>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</p><p>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</p><p>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.</p><p>Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:</p><p>Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!</p><p>O anything, of nothing first create!</p><p>O heavy lightness! serious vanity!</p><p>Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!</p><p>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!</p><p>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</p><p>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</p><p>Dost thou not laugh?</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>No coz, I rather weep.</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>Good heart, at what?</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>At thy good heart’s oppression.</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>Why such is love’s transgression.</p><p>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</p><p>Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest</p><p>With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown</p><p>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</p><p>Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;</p><p>Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;</p><p>Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:</p><p>What is it else? A madness most discreet,</p><p>A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.</p><h2>Farewell, my coz.</h2><h2> [_Going._]</h2><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>Soft! I will go along:</p><p>And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here.</p><p>This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>Tell me in sadness who is that you love?</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>What, shall I groan and tell thee?</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,</p><p>A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.</p><p>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>A right good markman, and she’s fair I love.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit</p><p>With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;</p><p>And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,</p><p>From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.</p><p>She will not stay the siege of loving terms</p><p>Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,</p><p>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:</p><p>O she’s rich in beauty, only poor</p><p>That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;</p><p>For beauty starv’d with her severity,</p><p>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</p><p>She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,</p><p>To merit bliss by making me despair.</p><p>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</p><p>Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><p>O teach me how I should forget to think.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>By giving liberty unto thine eyes;</p><p>Examine other beauties.</p><h2>ROMEO.</h2><h2>’Tis the way</h2><p>To call hers, exquisite, in question more.</p><p>These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,</p><p>Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;</p><p>He that is strucken blind cannot forget</p><p>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.</p><p>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,</p><p>What doth her beauty serve but as a note</p><p>Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?</p><p>Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.</p><h2>BENVOLIO.</h2><p>I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.</p><h2> [_Exeunt._]</h2><h2>SCENE II.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p><p>Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of</p><p>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of</p><p>computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It</p><p>exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations</p><p>from people in all walks of life.</p><p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the</p><p>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s</p><p>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will</p><p>remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project</p><p>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure</p><p>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future</p><p>generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary</p><p>Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see</p><p>Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p><p>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p><p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit</p><p>501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the</p><p>state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal</p><p>Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification</p><p>number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary</p><p>Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by</p><p>U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p><p>The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,</p><p>Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up</p><p>to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website</p><p>and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p><p>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg</p><p>Literary Archive Foundation</p><p>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread</p><p>public support and donations to carry out its mission of</p><p>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be</p><p>freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest</p><p>array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations</p><p>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt</p><p>status with the IRS.</p><p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating</p><p>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United</p><p>States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a</p><p>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up</p><p>with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations</p><p>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND</p><p>DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state</p><p>visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p><p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we</p><p>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition</p><p>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who</p><p>approach us with offers to donate.</p><p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make</p><p>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from</p><p>outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p><p>Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation</p><p>methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other</p><p>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To</p><p>donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p><p>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p><p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project</p><p>Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be</p><p>freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and</p><p>distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of</p><h2>volunteer support.</h2><p>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed</p><p>editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in</p><p>the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not</p><p>necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper</p><h2>edition.</h2><p>Most people start at our website which has the main PG search</p><p>facility: www.gutenberg.org.</p><p>This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,</p><p>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary</p><p>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to</p><p>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p></div>
